# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
This project was an exercise in implementing recently-completed modules in Python basics, Git and GitHub, Advanced Python and Object-Oriented Programming. 

"Hangman.py" is the game script, the "milestone" scripts contain the stages in which the game was built. To run the game, ensure you have "Hangman.py" and
"wordlist.txt" in your working directory, then simply run `python Hangman.py`
